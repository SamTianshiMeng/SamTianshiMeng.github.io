      <h3>High School Projects</h3>
       <hr>            
        <p>
           While in high school I was really passionate about different modern engineering feats such as the internal combustion engine of different automobiles to household 
           appliances such as the vaccum cleaner. Therefore one day while vaccuming I thought what if I could improve upon the current vaccum cleaner by utilizing static 
           electricity instead of the standard air suction. With that thought in mind I started my construction of the static electric vaccume cleaner, I first designed 
           the model using tinkercad then afterwards purchased the necessary parts of the model such as the semi conductor, metal rollers, and plastic plates to assemble 
           the model. After assembly I tested the vaccum on different materials and the performance was decent while the performance could improve it is too dangerous to 
           increase the output as I risk shocking myself. This project was initial meant to go on a science competition but due to Covid-19 the competition was cancelled 
           therefore it did not see the light of day till now.

        <h3>University Programming Projects</h3>
         <hr>            
          <p>
           Due to the future potiential of IT (Information Technology), I decided to pursue the business technology program at TMU (Toronto Metroplitan University) where I learned
           to program with different languages such as python, SQL, html, javascript, and CSS. One of the more notable project that I build with python is the  
            Credit Data AI prediction model where I constructed a non-parametic supervised learning algorithm 
           decision tree model. The advantages of the decision tree model is that it's easy to understand and by adjusting the fitting to prevent overfitting and hypertuning the parameters 
           I was able to achieve a high F1 score for the test set. The html project is the personal website as you could see here with the interactive elements such as changing the text size 
           and light and dark mode of the website. Before I graduate I intend to build more projects that demonstrate my programming the skills.
