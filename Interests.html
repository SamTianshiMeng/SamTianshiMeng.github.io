  <h3>Olympic Shooting </h3>
   <hr>            
    <p>
       I was introduced to <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/olympic-shooting-air-rifle-3-positions-rapid-fire-air-pistol-shotgun-trap-skeet" id="Olympic">Olympic Shooting</a> while participating in the Royal Canadian Air Cadets, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience as it taught me to remain calm under stressful 
       situations, as well as providing an effect similar to mediation as it allowed me to collect my thoughts. Since I was really passionate about Olympic Shooting I want to shoot 
       for the stars aim for Olympic Champion. In which my journey started when i competed in a regional competition with a cadet rifle while everyone had olympic level rifle 
       and despite the disadvantage I was middle of the pack and this strange behavior caught the eye of my now coach Pat Vamplew (former Olympian). After getting to know me 
       he determined that I have the potiental to succeed and gave me my initial gears and my first olympic rifle in which I won a regional competition with 3 month of training 
       then provincial championships 5 month later. Finally I won nationals in 2022 after training for 2 years, but due to a recent injury, I did not qualify for the pan american 
       games.

    <h3>Anime and Games</h3>
     <hr>            
      <p>
        I had always enjoyed different video games and animated series since I was young, from series such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto" id="Naruto">naruto</a> 
        to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_(TV_series)" id="Bleach">bleach</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_Tail" id="Fairy tail">fairy tail</a>. 
        Currently I enjoyed watching the popular genre of isekai anime which has a setting in another world and the protagonist is usually from the modern world of the 21st century and by using modern day
        knowledge the protagonist succeeds in the otherworld (usually fantasy). For games I was a avid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II:_Wings_of_Liberty" id="SC2">starcraft 2</a> player 
        when I was young due to the lack of social interaction within the game as it is mostly a 1v1 game therefore I transition to 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends" id="League">league of legends</a> where I have reached diamond a rank where I could tryout for the esport team at 
        Toronto Metroplitan university. Due to the discipline and competitive nature that I developed during my journey for olympic shooting I am able to achieve a 
        relatively high rank in most competitive game.
